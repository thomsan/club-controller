# GPIO client ESP8266

Depending on the model of the chip, some GPIOs have special functionality and behaviour (high/low at boot). Please make sure to check the pinout and use the appropriate GPIO for your purpose.

A good reference for ESP8266 pinouts can be found [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-pinout-reference-gpios/).
